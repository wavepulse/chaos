# Chaos

Chaos is a NuGet package which wraps SDL3 for C#. It is designed to be simple and easy to use, while still providing a powerful and flexible API. It will provide classes for creating windows, rendering graphics, handling input, and playing audio, etc... without using the low-level SDL3 API.
